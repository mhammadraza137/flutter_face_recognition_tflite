Developed a Flutter project for face detection and recognition using packages including 
- [tflite_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/tflite_flutter) 
- [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
- [camera](https://pub.dev/packages/camera)
- [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image)
- [google_mlkit_face_detection](https://pub.dev/packages/google_mlkit_face_detection)
